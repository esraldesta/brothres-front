# Contributing to Brothers Community

We welcome contributions to our Project! This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to our project.

**Branches**

Our repository has three branches:

* `master`: This branch contains the latest stable version of our code. **Do not push code directly to this branch.**
* `full-time`: This branch is where I will be working on new features and bug fixes. If you need to collaborate with me on a feature, please reach out to me and we can discuss the best approach.
* `part-time`: This branch is where you can submit pull requests with your contributions. I will review and merge pull requests into this branch.

**Submitting Pull Requests**

To submit a pull request, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Checkout the `part-time` branch in your forked repository.
3. Make small, incremental changes to the code.
4. Write a clear and concise commit message that describes the changes you made.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Submit a pull request to the `part-time` branch in the original repository.

**Pull Request Guidelines**

* Make sure your pull request is focused on a single feature or bug fix.
* Write a clear and concise pull request message that describes the changes you made.
* Make sure your code is well-tested and follows our coding style guidelines.

**Important**

* **Do not push code directly to the `master` branch.** We need to ensure that code is bug-free before merging it to the `master` branch.
* Only submit pull requests to the `part-time` branch. I will review and merge pull requests into this branch.
* **Do not Install a new package**
* * **Avoid creating new pages**

**Maintainer**

This project is maintained by [Harun Bekri](https://github.com/hariyebk). If you have any questions or need help with a pull request, feel free to reach out to me.

By following these guidelines, you can help us maintain a high-quality codebase and ensure that our project is successful.
